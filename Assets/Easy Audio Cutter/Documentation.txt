Easy Audio Cutter - User Manual
Trim Tab

Trimming: Allows trimming a specific section of an audio clip by adjusting Start and End sliders.

Fades: Fade In and Fade Out durations can be customized to create smooth transitions. You can fine-tune the fade shapes using the Animation Curve fields.

Reverse Audio: Toggle this option to reverse the selected audio section (great for SFX like rewinds or magic effects).

Waveform Seeking: Click anywhere on the waveform visualization to instantly jump (seek) to that time during preview.

Real-time Update: The waveform updates in real-time as you adjust trim, fade, or reverse settings.

Merge Tab

Combine Clips: Combines multiple audio files into a single continuous clip.

Reorder: Use the '↑' and '↓' buttons next to each clip to change their order in the sequence.

Format Requirement: All audio files added to the list must have the same format (same sample rate and channel count) to ensure compatibility.

Preview: You can listen to the entire merged sequence before saving.

Adjust Volume Tab

Volume Control: Increases or decreases the volume of a single selected audio file.

Range: Use the slider range from -1 to 1. Negative values decrease volume, positive values increase it.

Safety: The tool automatically clamps values to prevent audio clipping (distortion).

Output: Saves the modified clip with an _Adjusted suffix to preserve the original file.
